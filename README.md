# ScriptJack #

ScriptJack is based on the [codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) tutorial. It uses the [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) for the user interface. You can fork or download this repository and open the index.html in your browser to play the game. Have fun!

The cards I used in this project are from here: [White Oxygen Playing Card Faces](http://openclipart.org/detail/171444/white-oxygen-playing-card-faces-by-lone-coder-171444)
